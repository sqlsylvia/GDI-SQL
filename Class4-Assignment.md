## Class Practice
Create a table for your project.  
### Design  
   - What columns/attributes would your table have?
   - What data would you load into your table?
 
### Develop it!
  - Develop a CREATE TABLE statement for your table with a PRIMARY KEY, NOT 
  NULL Contraints
  - Develop two or more INSERT statements to load your table.
  - What kind of queries can you create to answer questions about your table?
